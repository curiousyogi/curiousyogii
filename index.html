      <h2>Questions Are the New Answers</h2>
      <p>Questions are incredibly powerful — they open up a path where answers begin to reveal themselves. When you start asking yourself meaningful questions, you begin to discover clarity and direction.</p>
      <p>In today’s world, many people have become overly dependent on others for guidance. But the truth is, your best answers come from within. Ask yourself what is truly good or bad for you. And if you're struggling with certain problems, turn inward — practice meditation, yogic kriyas, and take peaceful walks in nature. These tools help you connect with your inner wisdom, where most answers already live.</p>

Instead, you're filled with enthusiasm and happiness — no matter what problems arise. Curiosity keeps your spirit alive and your mind always ready to explore.</p>
