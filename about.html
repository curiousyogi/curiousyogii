    <p>I am your <strong>Curious Yogi</strong>, here to spark your curiosity about various topics — your views, thoughts, ideas, and more. The curiosity to learn has no limits because <em>"the end is the beginning."</em> It means that nothing truly ends — not even education, which is vast and ever-expanding.</p>
    <p>Curious Yogis are lifelong learners, always seeking new perspectives and deepening their understanding of life and tradition. Their curiosity isn't a distraction — it's the very engine that powers their practice and fuels their personal growth.</p>
